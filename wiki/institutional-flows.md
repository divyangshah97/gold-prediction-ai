## Why This Matters

Central banks are the structural buyer. But institutions and hedge funds drive short-to-medium term price momentum. Two data series capture this:

1. **GLD ETF Tonnes** — SPDR GLD holds physical gold. Daily changes in holdings reflect institutional buy/sell flow. A rising GLD tonne count = institutions adding gold exposure. A falling count = profit-taking or risk-off rotation out of gold.

2. **CFTC COT Managed Money** — Every Tuesday, COMEX gold futures positions are recorded. The "Managed Money" category (hedge funds, CTAs, asset managers) shows their net long/short stance. Published every Friday. Key: this is a contrarian indicator at extremes — when MM net-long is historically high, the easy money is made and a correction is likely. When MM is near net-short, upside risk is elevated.

## Signal Rule (Factor 6 in Daily Trading Signal)

| Condition | Score |
|---|---|
| GLD inflows AND MM net-long increasing | +1 Bullish |
| GLD outflows AND MM net-short increasing | -1 Bearish |
| Signals contradict each other | 0 Neutral |
| Only one source available — use that signal | ±1 or 0 |
| No recent data (>7 days old) or GLD_MISSING | 0 Neutral |

## GLD ETF Holdings (Daily)

Data file: `prices/gld.csv`

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Date | Trading date |
| GLD_Tonnes | Total gold held by SPDR GLD ETF in tonnes |
| GLD_Tonnes_Change | Day-over-day change in tonnes (+ve = inflows, -ve = outflows) |

*Populated by the daily routine. First entry: 2026-05-30 onwards.*

## CFTC COT Managed Money (Weekly)

Data file: `prices/cot.csv`

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Report_Date | Tuesday "as-of" date for the CFTC report |
| Open_Interest | Total COMEX gold futures open interest (contracts, 1 contract = 100 troy oz) |
| MM_Long | Managed Money gross long positions |
| MM_Short | Managed Money gross short positions |
| MM_Net | Net position (Long − Short) |
| MM_Net_Change | Change in MM_Net from prior week |

*Populated by the Saturday COT routine. First entry: first Saturday after 2026-05-30.*

## Context: What Are "Extreme" Readings?

Historically for COMEX gold:
- **Very bullish extremes** (contrarian caution): MM_Net > 250,000 contracts net long
- **Very bearish extremes** (contrarian opportunity): MM_Net < 50,000 contracts or net short
- **Normal range**: 100,000–200,000 contracts net long

These thresholds shift over time as open interest grows. Always compare MM_Net as a % of Open_Interest for a cleaner read.

### Sentiment Interpretation (as of July 7)

MM_Net of +116,161 falls in the **Neutral zone (50,000–150,000 contracts)**. Hedge funds remain steadily net-long — the third consecutive week in the 105,000–120,000 range — well below historically crowded levels (>250,000). Open interest rose to 371,776, its highest since May, suggesting fresh capital entering the market on both sides.

**Week-over-week change:** +766 contracts — essentially flat, far below the ±20,000 significant positioning shift threshold. No extreme move flagged. Positioning is consolidating rather than extending.
