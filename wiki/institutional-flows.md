# Institutional & Hedge Fund Gold Flows

**Summary**: Tracks daily GLD ETF tonnage changes (institutional demand proxy) and weekly CFTC COT Managed Money positioning (hedge fund futures sentiment) to assess non-central-bank gold demand. **July 29 update**: Global gold ETFs saw **$8.9bn of outflows in June** (though H1 2026 overall remained net positive at $8bn); AUM fell 6% in H1 to $526bn on lower gold prices even as collective holdings rose 18t to 4,047t. CFTC: COMEX managed-money net longs **jumped 16% m/m in June to 538t** — the highest month-end position since January 2026 — rising even as the gold price weakened, a notable divergence. Note: this page's Factor 6 description below (GLD/CFTC-based) is superseded — Factor 6 in the live signal methodology is now "Dollar Pressure" (DXY + USD/INR), not ETF/CFTC flows; see [[signal-methodology]].

## Why This Matters

Central banks are the structural buyer. But institutions and hedge funds drive short-to-medium term price momentum. Two data series capture this:

1. **GLD ETF Tonnes** — SPDR GLD holds physical gold. Daily changes in holdings reflect institutional buy/sell flow. A rising GLD tonne count = institutions adding gold exposure. A falling count = profit-taking or risk-off rotation out of gold.

2. **CFTC COT Managed Money** — Every Tuesday, COMEX gold futures positions are recorded. The "Managed Money" category (hedge funds, CTAs, asset managers) shows their net long/short stance. Published every Friday. Key: this is a contrarian indicator at extremes — when MM net-long is historically high, the easy money is made and a correction is likely. When MM is near net-short, upside risk is elevated.

## Signal Rule (Factor 6 in Daily Trading Signal)

| Condition | Score |
|---|---|
| GLD inflows AND MM net-long increasing | +1 Bullish |
| GLD outflows AND MM net-short increasing | -1 Bearish |
| Signals contradict each other | 0 Neutral |
| Only one source available — use that signal | ±1 or 0 |
| No recent data (>7 days old) or GLD_MISSING | 0 Neutral |

## CFTC COT Managed Money (Weekly)

Data file: `prices/cot.csv`

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| Report_Date | Tuesday "as-of" date for the CFTC report |
| Open_Interest | Total COMEX gold futures open interest (contracts, 1 contract = 100 troy oz) |
| MM_Long | Managed Money gross long positions |
| MM_Short | Managed Money gross short positions |
| MM_Net | Net position (Long − Short) |
| MM_Net_Change | Change in MM_Net from prior week |

*Populated by the Saturday COT routine. First entry: first Saturday after 2026-05-30.*

## Context: What Are "Extreme" Readings?

Historically for COMEX gold:
- **Very bullish extremes** (contrarian caution): MM_Net > 250,000 contracts net long
- **Very bearish extremes** (contrarian opportunity): MM_Net < 50,000 contracts or net short
- **Normal range**: 100,000–200,000 contracts net long

These thresholds shift over time as open interest grows. Always compare MM_Net as a % of Open_Interest for a cleaner read.

### Sentiment Interpretation (as of July 21)

MM_Net of +124,831 falls in the **Neutral zone (50,000–150,000 contracts)**. Hedge funds have continued their slow, steady accumulation — MM_Net has now risen for six consecutive reported weeks, from +93,540 (May 19) to +124,831, a cumulative increase of +31,291 contracts. Despite the grind higher, the level remains well below historically crowded extremes (>250,000), suggesting the trade is not yet consensus-crowded.

Open interest dipped slightly to 383,368 from the prior week's 383,689 — essentially flat, consistent with positioning consolidation rather than a broad influx of new money. Gross shorts ticked slightly higher (16,656 vs. 16,126 prior week), reversing the multi-week trend of short-covering, though still at historically low levels.

**Week-over-week change:** +4,052 contracts — a modest continuation of the grind higher, well below the ±20,000 significant positioning shift threshold. No extreme move flagged. Positioning is extending long incrementally, suggesting maintained conviction rather than momentum chasing.
